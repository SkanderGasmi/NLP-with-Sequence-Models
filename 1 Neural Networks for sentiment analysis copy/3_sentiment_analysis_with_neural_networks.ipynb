    "In [the NLP with classification and vector spaces repository ](https://github.com/SkanderGasmi/NLP-with-classification-and-vector-spaces), we implemented Logistic regression and Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis. However if we were to give those models an example like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center> <span style='color:blue'> <b>This movie was almost good.</b> </span> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "they would have predicted a positive sentiment for that review. However, that sentence has a negative sentiment and indicates that the movie was not good. To solve those kinds of misclassifications, we will write a program that uses deep neural networks to identify sentiment in text. \n",
