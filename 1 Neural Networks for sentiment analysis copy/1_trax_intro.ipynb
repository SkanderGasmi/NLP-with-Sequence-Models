    "# Trax \n",
    "\n",
    "Trax is a concise framework, built on TensorFlow, for end to end machine learning. The key building blocks are layers and combinators. This notebook is just a taste to get familiar with the Trax framework and use some of its basic building blocks."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Trax and not TensorFlow or PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow and PyTorch are both extensive frameworks that can do almost anything in deep learning. They offer a lot of flexibility, but that often means verbosity of syntax and extra time to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trax is much more concise. It runs on a TensorFlow backend but allows us to train models with 1 line commands. Trax also runs end to end. This means we can focus on learning, instead of spending hours on the peculiarities of big framework implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why not Keras then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is now part of Tensorflow itself from 2.0 onwards. Also, trax is good for implementing new state of the art algorithms like Transformers, Reformers, BERT because it is actively maintained by Google Brain Team for advanced deep learning tasks. It runs smoothly on CPUs,GPUs and TPUs as well with comparatively lesser modifications in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Code in Trax\n",
    "Building models in Trax relies on 2 key concepts:- **layers** and **combinators**.\n",
    "Trax layers are simple objects that process data and perform computations. They can be chained together into composite layers using Trax combinators, allowing us to build layers and models of any complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trax, JAX, TensorFlow and Tensor2Tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentionned earlier, Trax uses Tensorflow as a backend, but it also uses the JAX library to speed up computation too. \"JAX is like an enhanced and optimized version of numpy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor2Tensor on the other hand started as an end to end solution much like how Trax is designed, but it grew unwieldy and complicated. So Trax as the new improved version that operates much faster and simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trax source code can be found on Github: [Trax](https://github.com/google/trax)\n",
    "- JAX library: [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n"
